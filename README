Enable Headphones
-----------------

This small project enables the headphone output of the sound card of my laptop.
It is provided "as-is" without any warranty and even if it is working on, it
might as well does not work on your computer.


What does it do ?
-----------------

Sometimes ALSA misconfigures the headphone output of my sound card and no sound
comes out. Using hda-analyzer (from http://git.alsa-project.org/?p=alsa.git)
I was able to find a setting in an ALSA node which was wrongly changed each
time a Jack cable is pluged in. Changing this setting solves the sound problem,
but it is painful to do it by hand (with HDA-Analyzer GUI). Therefore I have
written a small Python to do it automatically for me.
