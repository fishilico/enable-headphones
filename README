enable-headphones
-----------------

Small project which enables headphones on my laptop using ALSA hda-analyzer
tools. It is provided "as-is" without any warranty and even if it is working on
my laptop, it might as well does not work on your computer.

What does it do ?
-----------------
Sometimes ALSA misconfigured the headphones output and no sound came out.
Using hda-analyzer I was able to find a setting in an ALSA node which was wrong.
Changing this settings everytime by hand is painful so I wrote a small Python
script to do it automatically for me.
